### Description
The goal of this project is to create a virtual reality training tool to be used in modular home development. In modular home development, the houses are built in pieces in a factory and then shipped out to the construction site to be assembled together. The factories are broken up into different stations, with each station being dedicated to a different piece of the house. The VR training tool utilizes a 3D simulation of the factory in order to train workers on the tasks of each station. The workers will be given written instructions that correspond to each step of the station as well as helpful guides to know where certain parts are supposed to go. By using the virtual training tool, factories will be able to train workers on the different parts of the factory without having to halt or slow down production. Not only can this be used for new workers, but if there is ever any change in the way a station works, then all workers in the factory will be able to use this tool to be retrained on the station.
    
The project focuses on the floor building station of the factory. Here, workers are tasked with assembling the floor pieces that will be in the houses. The workers will begin with creating the frame with a combination of band boards and rim joists. Once the frame is completed, the worker will then attach joist hangers along the inside of the rim joists. After all the rim joists are attached to the rim joists, the worker can then lay the joists into the joist hangers and attach them.
